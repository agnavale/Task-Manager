Q. How long did you spend on the coding test? <br>
I spent 3 days.<br><br>

Q. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.<br>
The most useful feature was JavaScript Date Objects. JavaScript will use the browser's time zone and display a date as a full text string. <br>
For example const d = new Date();<br><br>
